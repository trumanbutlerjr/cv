      <center><em>Persistence Coordinator</em> at <a href="https://www.discoveryhsf.org/o/kenner-discovery">Kenner Discovery Health Sciences Academy</a></center>

    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <p>
      My career objective is to operate as a school leader to ensure the best educational methods and structures are used in the building of human capital.
      <br><br>I received extensive graduate training in quantitative educational research and evaluation. I honed these skills by attending extracurricular learning events such as on-campus methodology workshops and exclusive national institutes on statistics and evaluation. My research efforts have thus far culminated into a co-authored publication and an invitation to present a research paper at an annual conference hosted by the American Educational Research Association. As a supplement to my coursework and research, I served as a teaching assistant for a psychology course.
      <br><br>In my current role of Post-Secondary Persistence Coordinator, and as a OneGoal Program Director, I use data-driven methods to support students’ academic transition into post-secondary education. Through daily classroom sessions, I assist cohorts of students with alignment of personal proclivities and educational and career prospects. I also establish routine student check-ins and visit classrooms to ensure student work ethic and conduct is conducive to academic learning and assist the academic counselors as they create and modify students’ schedules and individual graduation plans.
      <br><br>In the future, I hope to utilize my knowledge and skill sets in the arena of career and technical education. I have an intense desire to contribute to workforce development by augmenting the talent pipeline in a way that provides appropriate opportunities to all students, especially those in the lower academic margins. I have begun to address this in my current role by bridging connections between working professionals and lower grade students through classroom visits.
